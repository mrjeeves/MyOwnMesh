//! Signaling for MyOwnMesh. Today's only strategy is Nostr; sibling
//! crates can add others (BitTorrent trackers, MQTT, IPFS, Firebase)
//! and the engine picks at construction time.
//!
//! Wire-compatibility note: the room-handle derivation and relay
//! shuffle in [`nostr`] are byte-compatible with upstream Trystero
//! `0.24.x` so a future hybrid deployment (JS Trystero peers + Rust
//! MyOwnMesh peers, both using the same TRYSTERO_APP_ID) is
//! possible. By default the app-ids differ
//! (`myownmesh-cloud-mesh-v1` vs `myownllm-cloud-mesh-v1`) so the
//! two ecosystems never meet on the wire.
//!
//! See [`upstream`] for the catalogue of upstream Trystero
//! limitations this implementation works around natively — without
//! requiring users to apply patches.
